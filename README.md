# PARTICLE REPRODUCTION OF SNOWFALL - THREE.js & WebGL


### Aims
* Create a particle-system representation of SnowGlobe. 
* Use THREE.js as inteface to WebGL.
* Emphasize use of shaders and technologies studied. 
* Summary study on efficiency of application.

### Performances
It’s not easy to evaluate performances of a system strongly based on hardware design and software optimization. It’s only possible make some considerations:
* Using a MacBook Pro Retina (2,4 GHz Intel Core i5, Intel Iris 1536 MB) and Safari as reference, were observed results below:
